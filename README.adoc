Proof-of-concept using Jandex "behind" HCANN.

We want to migrate away from HCANN for processing annotations in Hibernate.  However, lots of code directly uses HCANN
making a one-shot transition is difficult.  This projct attempts to prove how well it works to have HCANN use Jandex for
annotation processing and a first step in a staggered transition.
